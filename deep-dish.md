Deep Dish
=========

Dough: 

 - 450 g flour
 - 15 g salt
 - 40 g cornmeal
 - 12 g sugar
 - 9 g dry active yeast
 - 110 g cold butter
 - 275 g water @ 85 F

Mix:

 - 1/4 onion
 - 2 garlic cloves
 - 2 Tbsp butter
 - 5 g salt
 - 40 g tomato paste
 - 28z crushed tomatoes
 - 10 g suagar
 - 1 g basil + oregano

Toppings and other mix: 

 - hot italian sausage  
 - 24 oz mozzarella
 - 4 Tbsp olive oil



Process:

Mix all dry dough ingredients in food proccesor with butter. Then, start adding warm water while running.
Let rise for 90 minutes.

Grate 1/4 onion.
Cook garlic and onions with butter. Add salt. Add tomato paste. Wait 30 seconds to let tomato paste cook, then add crushed tomatoes. Add sugar, basil, oregano.
Simmer 20 minutes, then chill.

Grate mozzarella then chill.
Make homemade Italian sausage (if doing so, not described here, I use store bought), then chill.

Preheat oven to 425 F / 220 C. 

Dough should bounce back when poked. Roll out entire dough to fit a large (14 inch or so) cast iron skillet (ok to be generous with flour or corn meal while rolling). For a half recipe use a 10 inch pan (approx 1/2 surface area).
Add olive oil to skillet and spread around (4 Tbsp is quite generous). Then add dough to pan, it should go up the sides.

Add cheese first (bottom layer).
Add chunks of Italian sausage.
Pour sauce on top (top layer).

Put in oven for 35 to 40 minutes (check-in at 25 minutes).

Let the pizza cool for at least 15 minutes before cutting.
