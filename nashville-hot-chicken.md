Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwiches
================================

Nashville hot chicken is a style of fried chicken (with a buttermilk dredge) that is covered in either dry or "wet" (oily, not water) mixture of hot spices (mainly cayenne). As a sandwich it is traditionally served either on white bread buns (plain hamburger buns) or on biscuits.

Recommended: serve with fries and extra cole slaw.  

Tools
-----

- Deep fryer / deep pot
- Metal tongs (suitable for deep frying)
- Basting brush (for wet rub)
- Several small containers for mixing sauces
- Several plates for dredging
- Meat thermometer
- Metal container for freezing leftover fried chicken

Ingredients
-----------

- Chicken thighs or breasts
- Cooking oil
- Buns
  - I prefer brioche buns. Other common options are generic white buns or biscuits
- Pickles (your preferred variety)
- **Marinade**
- **Wet rub**
- **Flour mix**
- **Cole slaw**
- **Comeback sauce**
- **Ranch**

Steps
-----

1. Prepare **marinade**
2. Prepare **wet rub** (except oil)
3. Prepare **flour mix**
4. Prepare **cole slaw**
5. Prepare **comeback sauce**
6. Prepare **Ranch**
7.  Dredge chicken through **flour mix**
8. Dredge floured chicken through **marinade**
9. Re-dredge wet chicken through **flour mix**
10. Heat oil to 350 F -- about 2" deep, or enough to barely cover chicken
11. Deep fry chicken to 160 F (breasts) 165 F (thighs), about 6 to 8 minutes total (some recipes call for longer). Best bet, until the outside looks browned.
12. Finish preparing **wet rub** with used oil (let oil cool for 5 to 10 minutes first)
13. Serve chicken on bun with pickles, **cole slaw**, **comeback sauce**, and **ranch**. Suggested order:
  - Bottom bun
  - Cole slaw (generously)
  - Chicken
  - Ranch
  - Pickles
  - Comeback sauce
  - Top bun
14. Keep extra comeback sauce and ranch ready for dipping

Marinade
========

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 cup buttermilk
  - Or 1 Tbsp lemon juice or ACV with remaining volume whole milk
- 2 Tbsp tobasco
- 1 egg

Steps
-----

1. Whisk all ingredients (prepare fake buttermilk 10 min ahead of time if not using real buttermilk)

Wet rub
=======

Ingredients
-----------

Consider multiplying this recipe and making extra -- you do not want to run out  

- 1/4 cup used oil (from frying chicken)
- 2 Tbsp butter
- 1 to 3 Tbsp cayenne, depending on desired spice level (this is the star ingredient most responsible for the flavor)
- 1+1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 Tbsp brown Sugar
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp black pepper

Steps
-----

1. Mix all ingredients except used oil
2. Start deep frying chicken
3. After deep frying, allow oil to cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Collect 1/4 cup and mix with remaining ingredients (this will melt the butter)  
4. End result should be fairly thick but spreadable with a basting brush

Comeback sauce
==============

This is a fairly generic southern style sauce not specific to any one place.  It is essentially a spicy garlic mayo with ketchup and some savory flavorings. You can find it at the store sometimes, but this is a good reference recipe. The ranch should not be thick like ketchup, but runnier, like consistency of buffalo sauce.

Ingredients
-----------

- 1/2 cup mayo
- 2 Tbsp ketchup
- 2 Tbsp tobasco
- 1 tsp worchestershire
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp black pepper

Steps
-----

1. Mix all ingredients


Cole slaw
=========

This can also be fairly generic. Make whatever coleslaw you like, or buy a premade coleslaw to taste.  I know I like this particular recipe and so recommend it here as a reference.

This is intended to be served on the bun with the chicken, but I also recommend making extra to serve on the side.

Ingredients
-----------

- Bag of coleslaw mix at store (look for the salad kits and pick one with cabbage)
- 1+1/2 Tbsp vinegar (or ACV)
- 2 tsp sugar (or to taste)
- 1/2 tsp celery seed (this is the star ingredient most responsible for the flavor)
- Salt and pepper to taste

Steps
-----

1. Ensure that the salad kit or vegetable ingredients are finely chopped.
2. Mix remaining ingredients separately. You can make extra and store it separately
3. Mix wet ingredients with dry (vegetable) ingredients

Ranch
=====

This recipe is a work in progess. If you can find a brand of ranch you like, just use that. A word of warning: unlike the coleslaw and comeback sauce, I find the generic pre-mixed wet ranch (name brand or store brand) to be substantially unsuitable for this use case, so here are some options.

Alternative 1
-------------

Use a pre-prepared dry mix of ranch seasoning and wet it at home with sour cream. This tastes substantially different from the wet pre-mixed ranches even of the same brand.

- Generic brand packet of dry ranch mix
- 16 oz (1 pint) sour cream

1. Follow instructions on dry mix (mix with sour cream and refrigerate for 10 min)

Alternative 2
-------------

No ranch flavor at all. The idea for this one is just to have sour cream, but made more runny with milk.

- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 1 Tbsp whole milk
- Garlic and onion powder to taste

1. Mix ingredients
