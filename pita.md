Pita with pockets
=================

Very simple recipe for creating pita with pockets. The most important tips I can give to ensure that pockets actually form:

Tips
----
 - Weigh the water and dough, don't rely on volume
 - You must use a **HOT HOT HOT** surface. Cast iron skillet is good for this
 - You must roll the dough to the correct thickness
 - You must control the moisture content of rolled dough and not let it dry before cooking

Ingredients
-----------

 - 240 g flour
 - extra working flour
 - 1 Tbsp sugar
 - 1 Tbsp yeast
 - 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
 - 1 Tbsp extra working high temperature oil
 - 160 grams (2/3 cup) water, at temperature of 90f - 100f

Tools
-----

 - A hot surface (I use cast iron skillet)
 - Spatula
 - Food processor (optional but much easier this way)
 - rolling pin

Steps
-----

1. Add the sugar and yeast to the warmed water. Check that it is activated and working (do NOT overheat the water and kill the yeast, use a thermometer!)
2. Mix flour, olive oil, and activated yeast-sguar-water to food processor and mix (you can do this by hand, instead)
3. Allow dough to rise in the fridge for a couple hours COVERED
4. Preheat skillet on stove with 1 Tbsp vegetable oil (thin, thin layer) until SEARING hot (oil will smoke, but be fire safe -- NEVER extinguish oil flame with water)
5. Take 1/8th a piece of dough (this is 1 pita -- this recipe makes 8 pita)
6. Roll dough to 1/4 to 1/8 inch thick. **Must get this right**, you'll have to figure out exactly what works for you and stick with it.
7. Throw rolled dough onto searing hot pan and leave for ~10 seconds or so (very short time, enough to just barely sear and seal that side)
8. Flip dough
9. You should start to see a pocket quickly forming.  Gently push down on and/or rock the pocket with a spatula if the bubble is struggling to spread evenly throughout the dough
10. Pita should be fully cooked with a pocket after ~30 seconds

Pockets can be stored sealed in fridge. If you are successful, you should have 50 to 100% success rate at pocket formation (4/8 to 8/8 pitas should have pockets, I usually get 6 or 7).

Troubleshooting
---------------
Pockets not forming?

- Is your stove not hot enough?
- Stove TOO hot? If pitas turn black and cook <30 seconds it might be
- Do not roll dough in batches. Roll 1 at a time and cook, otherwise the rolled dough will dry out and your last pitas will fail to pocket
- You can experiment with adding extra flour or cornmeal after rolling to help pocket formation
- Rolling too thin or too thick will cause pockets to fail or not form at all
