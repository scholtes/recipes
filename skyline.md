Skyline Chili
=============

Copycat recipe for the Skyline Chili (a famous Cincinnati
style chili). This recipe is just the base meat sauce, intended to be served with conies or pasta.

This recipe comes mostly from [Elite Recipe Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FuDnpO51Uc) on YouTube who has done all the research to make this possible. I have modified it to my own taste.

Tips
----
Elite Recipe Source uses fresh ground spices. I am using pre-ground spices so the quantities below may be higher than in the video.

If you have never had Cincinnati style chili before, it is more like a meat sauce. You almost certainly would never want to eat this by itself in a bowl. It is best  served with ridiculously generous portions of cheddar cheese either on a coney and bun or on pasta. Raw diced onion, mustard, and beans are also common additions during the assembly/plating stage.

Tools
-----

 - Large pot
 - Stove
 - Stirring spoon
 - Separate container for dry spices
 - Scale
 - tsp measuring spoons

Ingredients
-----------

 - Ground beef (1.5 lbs)
 - Beef heart (0.5 lbs)
 - Water (to cover)
 - \*Tomato paste (9oz)
 
 - \*Fleischmann's instant dry yeast 7tsp
 - \*Brewer's/Nutritional yeast 4 tsp

 - \*Salt (2+1/2 tsp)
 - \*Allspice (3 tsp)
 - \*Cayenne (1/2 tsp)
 - Saigon cinnamon (1+5/8 tsp)
 - Cloves (1+1/4 tsp)
 - Cumin (1/2 tsp)
 - Chili Powder (1/4 tsp)
 - Black pepper (1/8 tsp)
 - Onion powder (1+3/4 tsp)
 - Paprika (1+3/8 tsp)

\* Tomato paste, yeast, salt, allspice, and cayenne can be dialed up as needed.

Steps
-----

1. Measure and mix all dry ingredients in a side bowl.
2. Dice beef heart. Substitute with ground beef is okay.
3. Add raw ground beef and heart directly to pot and cover with **cold** water. **Do not pre-brown the beef.**
4. Thoroughly apart the beef in the cold water.
5. Turn on heat to low simmer.
6. Add tomato paste.
7. Once the pot comes to temperature, add dry ingredients.
8. Cook uncovered for 2 to 4 hours.
9. Taste and add **cautious** additions of asterisked spices above as necessary.

Serve immediately or reheated. Refrigerates very well.

Serving
-------

Common serving methods always include generous portions of finely shredded cheddar, either served on pasta or on a coney.

**Option A: Chili cheese conies**

Ingredients:  

 - your favorite hot dogs
 - your favorite buns
 - extra sharp cheddar (unshredded)
 - Diced onion (optional)
 - Mustard (optional)

Steam or microwave buns and boil hotdogs. Add dog to bun. Cover with chili. Add onion and mustard if desired. Cover with generous portions of freshly and finely shredded cheddar.

**Option B: 3, 4, or 5 way**

A "3-way" because it includes 3 ingredients: pasta, chili, cheese. 4 or 5 way when you add onions/beans.

Ingredients:
 
 - spaghetti, cooked with extra salt
 - extra sharp cheddar (unshredded)
 - Diced onion (optional)
 - kidney or black beans (optional)

Plate cooked pasta. Cover in chili. Add onion and beans if desired. Cover with generous portions of freshly and finely shredded cheddar.

Troubleshooting
---------------

 - Cincinnati chili, being closer to a meat sauce than other chilis, should have a fine texture and not be clumpy. Stirring thoroughly in cold water without browning achieves this texture.
 - Dry ingredients are added after coming to heat to kill the yeast quickly. The yeast should not activate and is there only for extra savory (umami) flavor that is missed by not browning.
